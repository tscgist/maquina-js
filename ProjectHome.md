Why do I need a state machine ?

Finite state machines have long been used as an organizing principle for designing and implementing complex behavior in event-driven programs, such as network adapters and compilers. Now, programmable Web browsers have opened a new event-driven environment to a new generation of applications. Browser-based applications, popularized by Ajax, are becoming more complex. Designers and implementers can benefit from the discipline and structure that finite state machines offer. In this article, you, learn how to use a finite state machine to design complex behavior for a simple Web widget â€” an animated tooltip that fades into and out of view.
